Nyaya - Legal & Compliance Document Intelligence Pipeline (Step 2 of 3)
=========================================================================
Implements the rest of the RAG architecture: retrieve -> assemble context
(dedupe + pack) -> answer -> cite (or say "I don't know").

Run AFTER build_vectorstore.py has been run at least once:
    uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
